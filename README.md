### Requirements

In `src/agent.ts`, implement an agent that does the following:

- Communicates with user via terminal
- Acts as an assistant for filling out a form at a veterinary clinic
- Collects the following information: breed, age, and weight
- Accepts information provided by the user in one or multiple messages
- Once all required information is gathered, outputs the result as JSON

* - If the user asks unrelated questions, gently steer the conversation back to the topic

### Development

To start script:
`npm run start`
